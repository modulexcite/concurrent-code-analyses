I really like this idea as I typically have my phone in Dark theme and switch to Light when in bright sunshine. Unfortunately not a lot of applications make use of these themes so I wanted to share the method I use to implement it.    I owe the technique to a great post from IdentityMine  essentially you derive a new static resource type which loads the correct themed xaml *before* your page has started to load.
